Personal hobbyproject

Began as an attempt to build an 2D engine, however, it became a testing ground for testing CMake, git, architectural design, building libraries statically and dynamically. Loading .dlls. and building DX11. No lonnger working and was interrupted in the middle of a refactor stage. I've learned what I want from this project and it will lay the foundation for a new project in the future.

I realised that I want to rebuild everything, so only still exist for the sake of documenting my old code.
